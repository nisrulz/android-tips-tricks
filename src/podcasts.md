# Podcasts to listen

1.  [Fragmented](http://fragmentedpodcast.com/)
2.  [Android Developers Backstage](https://androidbackstage.blogspot.in/)
3.  [Android Developer Podcasts](https://developer.android.com/podcasts)
There are others too, but the above two are the popular ones, you can lookup more using tag `android` on sites offering Podcast Services.

P.S : I use [Player.fm](https://player.fm/) to listen to these podcasts. They even have an [Android Client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fm.player&hl=en), all for FREE.
