Cheatsheet about tips and tricks for Android Development

This is a simple set of tips and tricks regarding Android Development which I have gathered from various sources. It helps me direct other android devs in my community regarding stuff each android dev should know about. Its also there for me to keep track of anything I either learn on my own or from other sources now and then when browsing the internet.

Contributions are always welcome, hoping people will help me in growing this. To contribute, simply open up a PR with the changes.

+ **Use plugins to become more efficient**
  1. [KeyPromoter](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/4455)
  
    The plugin basically will annoy the hell out of you by showing you a big screen overlay with the key combination you should have used , if you used your mouse to execute some command to a level when you basically would start using the key combination just to avoid KeyPromoter annoying you all the time. 
    Its also is useful features, like it will prompt you to create a key binding for a command which does not have a key binding and you have used it 3 times.
  1. [String Manipulation](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/2162)

    Provides actions for text manipulation such as Toggle case, encode/decode, sorting, 
  1. [Lines Sorter](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/5919)

    Add Sort Lines action in Edit menu to sort selected lines or whole file if selection is empty.
  1. [Findbugs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/3847?pr=idea) 

    Provides static byte code analysis to look for bugs in Java code from within Android Studio
  1. [Sonar Lint](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7973) 

    Plugin that provides on-the-fly feedback to developers on new bugs and quality issues injected into Java, JavaScript and PHP code.
  1. [Checkstyles](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1065) 

    Plugin provides both real-time and on-demand scanning of Java files from within Android Studio.
  1. [ADB Idea](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7380) 

    Plugin that adds ADB commands to Android Studio and Intellij such as ADB Uninstall App, ADB Kill App, ADB Restart App, etc

    Plugin which helps you find and implement the code you require in an instant.
  1. [Dagger IntelliJ Plugin](https://github.com/square/dagger-intellij-plugin) 

     The Dagger IntelliJ plugin creates visual connections between a @Inject object and the @Provides method that creates it.
+ **Use Live Templates in Android Studio**
  + `newInstance` - Generates the static `newInstance` function inside a Fragment
  + `Toast` - Generates `Toast.makeText(context, "", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();`
  + `fbc` - findViewById with cast
  + `const` - Define a android style int constant
  + `logd` - Generates `Log.d(TAG, "");`
  + `logm` - Log current method name and its arguments.
  + `logr` - Log result of the current method
  + `logt` - static logtaf with current classname
  + `psf` - public static final
  + `sout` - Prints a string to System.out
  + `soutm` - Prints current class and method names to System.out
  + `soutp` - Prints method parameter names and values to System.out
  + `visible` - Set view visibility to VISIBLE
  + `gone` - Set view visibility to GONE
  + `noInstance` - private empty constructor to prohibit instance creation
 
 
  [Comprehensive list of all Live Templates in Android Studio](https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/idea-live-templates)


 
+ **Postfix code completion in Android Studio**
  
  Android Studio/IntelliJ havea special kind of code completion which allows you to write code specific to a field
  + `<expr>.null` will auto complete to `if(<expr> == null)`
  + `<expr>.nootnull` will auto complete to `if(<expr> != null)`
  + `<expr>.var` will auto complete to `T name = <expr>` 
  + `<expr>.field` will auto complete to create a global field variable `field = <expr>`
  + `<ArrayExpr>.for` will auto complete to `for(T item : <Arrayexpr>)`
  + `<ArrayExpr>.fori` will auto complete to `for(int i = 0; i < <Arrayexpr>.length; i++)`
  + `<ArrayExpr>.forr` will auto complete to `for(int i = <Arrayexpr>.length - 1; i > 0 ; i--)`
  
  Complete list of available postfix code completion can be found at **Settings → Editor → Postfix Templates**
  
  
+ **Use the Darcula Theme in Android Studio**

  Ok, I know its more like a preference , but trust me using that keeps your eyes less strained as they would be if you used the Default Light theme.

+ **Don't use a small font**

  Preferably use a font in Android Studio thats easy to read and is at a font size which doesnot forces you to strain your eyes. I use [Menlo font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_(typeface)).

+ **Use a code style**

  You should use a standard codestyle, so possible contenders can be
  + [AOSP Codestyle](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html)
  + [Square IntelliJ Codestyle](https://github.com/square/java-code-styles)
+ **Use the [Embedded Terminal inside Android Studio](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/working-with-embedded-local-terminal.html)**
+ **Use the Memory/Network/CPU Monitor inside Android Studio to profile your code/app**
+ **[Configure Android Studio](https://medium.com/google-developer-experts/configuring-android-studio-4aa4f54f1153#.rq0z6qlaq)** 

####***Emulator***
Apart from using physical devices , one should use emulators as they are as of now easy to manage and equivalently powerful.

+ [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/)
+ [Intel Emulator bundled in SDK Manger](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator.html)

####***[Vysor](http://www.vysor.io/)***
This one needs special mention due to how useful it is. It basically is a window to your device i.e it streams and allows you to interact with your physical device on your laptop. Very useful when you are demo-ing your app during a presentation. You can interact with your physical device and it will be shown right in your laptop screen. It has a paid/free version , paid version is totally worth buying. 

####***[DeskDock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.floriandraschbacher.deskdock.free)***
Yes, vysor was great, but if you want to share your keyboard and mouse directly to your Android device, then this app is for you. It enables you to control your Android device as if it was part of your desktop computer. The [FREE version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.floriandraschbacher.deskdock.free) includes use of computer mouse, while the [PRO version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.floriandraschbacher.deskdock.pro) includes features such as use of keyboard. This is useful where you can test your app without your hands ever leaving your keyboard.

###***Make better choices while coding***

+ **Use OkHttp over HttpUrlConnect**

  HttpUrlConnect suffers from [quite some bugs](https://android-developers.blogspot.in/2011/09/androids-http-clients.html). [Okhttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) solves them in a more elegant manner. [[Reference Link]](https://corner.squareup.com/2013/05/announcing-okhttp.html)


+ **Reference local `aar` files as below [[Stackoverflow Ref](http://stackoverflow.com/a/28816265/2745762)]**
  ```gradle
    dependencies {
       compile(name:'nameOfYourAARFileWithoutExtension', ext:'aar')
     }
    repositories{
          flatDir{
                  dirs 'libs'
           }
     }

  ```

+ **Use [Pidcat](https://github.com/JakeWharton/pidcat) for a better log reading experience**

+ **Use some Version Control System(VCS) like [Git](https://git-scm.com/)**

+ **Use [ClassyShark](https://github.com/google/android-classyshark)**

  Its a standalone tool for Android Devs used to browse any Android executable and show important info such as class interfaces and members, dex counts and dependencies

+ **Use [Stetho](https://github.com/facebook/stetho)**

  Debug your android apps using Chrome Dev Tools. Includes tools like Network Monitor, Shared Preference explorer etc.

+ **Use [Battery Historian](https://github.com/google/battery-historian)**

  A tool to analyze battery consumers using Android "bugreport" files.

+ **Always use a constant version value like "24.2.0"**

  Avoid using `+` when specifying the version of dependencies.
  + Keeps one secured from unexpected API changes in the dependency.
  + Avoids doing an extra network call for the checking latest version of each dependency on every build.

+ **Use [Handler instead of a TimerTask](http://www.mopri.de/2010/timertask-bad-do-it-the-android-way-use-a-handler/)**
+ **[Do not use your own personal email for Google Play Developer Account](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/2hywu9/google_play_only_one_strike_is_needed_to_ruin_you/)**
+ **Use Vectors instead of PNG**

  If you do **have** to use png, compress them. Take a look at [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com).

+ **Use proguard**

  ```gradle
  android {
    ...
    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
  ```
+ **Use shrinkResources**

  ```gradle
  android {
    ...
    buildTypes {
        release {
            shrinkResources true
            minifyEnabled true
            ...
        }
    }
}
  ```

+ **[Simulating Android killing your app in the background](https://twitter.com/Jahnold/status/759775495655333888),  run in terminal**
  `adb shell am kill`

+ **Follow the below [rule to have faster gradle builds](https://medium.com/@skaliakoudas/decreasing-build-times-by-decreasing-gradle-memory-requirements-7fcafc6d98ea#.otnm0ofb6)**
  ```gradle
  Gradle memory >= Dex memory + 1Gb
  ```

+ **Split your apk using gradle when using Native code, do not bundle all of em together and ship!.. coz that will make you evil**

  ```gradle
  defaultConfig {
      ...
  
      ndk {
        abiFilters "armeabi", "armeabi-v7a", "mips", "x86"
      }
    }
  
  //Split into platform dependent APK
    splits {
      abi {
        enable true
        reset()
        include 'armeabi', 'armeabi-v7a', 'mips', 'x86' //select ABIs to build APKs for
        universalApk false //generate an additional APK that contains all the ABIs
      }
    }
  
    // map for the version code
    project.ext.versionCodes = ['armeabi': 1, 'armeabi-v7a': 2, 'mips': 5, 'x86': 8]
  
    // Rename with proper versioning
    android.applicationVariants.all { variant ->
      // assign different version code for each output
      variant.outputs.each { output ->
        output.versionCodeOverride =
            project.ext.versionCodes.get(output.getFilter(com.android.build.OutputFile.ABI), 0) *
                1000000 +
                android.defaultConfig.versionCode
      }
    }
  ```

+ **Learn about some architecture such as MVP or Clean**

+ **Try to understand and follow TDD (Test Driven Development)**

+ **To force re-download of dependencies**

  ```gradle 
  ./gradlew --refresh-dependencies
  ```
+ **To exclude a certain task from being run by gradle**

  Suppose you want to exclude the task `javaDoc` then use `-x` option followed by the task name, i.e `javaDoc` in this case.

  ```gradle 
  ./gradlew clean build -x javaDoc
  ```
+ **To have the each subproject script name match that of the project name**
  
  Then add this line in settings.gradle

  ```gradle
  rootProject.children.each{
    it.buildFileName = it.name + '.gradle'
  }
  ```

    ```
+ **Enable gradle to automatically download missing platforms in android sdk**
  
  Set the below property in your global `gradle.properties` file

    ```
    android.builder.sdkDownload=true
    ```

    > This is an experimental option and it only downloads build tools and platforms, but doesn't actually update Google or Support repository [[Bug Ref]](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=212309)

+ **Donot include both `jcenter()` & `mavenCentral()` in your `build.gradle` file**
  
  JCenter is a superset of MavenCentral. [[Ref tweet]](https://twitter.com/molsjeroen/status/791606774210199553)

+ **Clear your gradle cache if you think that bundled support and google play services lib in android sdk are inconsistent**

  + Goto `~/.gradle/caches/` and delete everything inside the `cache` folder.
  + Open SDK Manager and resync all support libs and google play services
  + Next re-sync your project
  + Everything should become consistent and functional.

+ **Setup handy `adb` aliases for your terminal** [[Ref Link]](https://medium.com/@jonfhancock/bash-your-way-to-better-android-development-1169bc3e0424#.8zcc4m5ch)

  Append the below **Aliases** to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file, save and restart the terminal. Once saved , use them as show in **Usage** column

  |Alias|Usage
  |---|---
  |`alias screenshot="adb exec-out screencap -p > screen-$(date -j "+%s").png"`|`screenshot`
  |`alias startintent="adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf 1 | xargs -I X adb -s X shell am start $1"`|`startintent https://twitter.com/nisrulz`

  android {
  ...
      lintOptions {
          abortOnError true
          fatal 'StopShip'
      }
  }
  ```
  If you have a `//STOPSHIP` comment in your code, this will cause an error to be thrown when a release apk is generated.
  > You can turn on //STOPSHIP highlighting in Android Studio (isn't enabled by default) in

###***Tips regarding UI/UX***


+ **Motion**
  + Material Design uses real-world metaphors as its foundation. Objects in the real world don't move linearly, they move in curved paths and accelerate and decelerate according to the motion's properties.
  + As such, motion should also use such properties and animate objects so that the motion feels natural rather than forced
  + For example, a car leaving the screen in a movie starts off slowly, then accelerates till it's out of the frame. Similarly, views should be interpolated using classes like AccelerateInterpolator, FastOutSlowInInterpolator, etc. [[More Info]](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/animation/TimeInterpolator.html
   
+ **Typography**
    +  While custom typefaces can be used for branding, it is essential to stick to Roboto and Noto if possible, especially for body text, due to their clarity and optimistic nature. 
    +  Roboto covers Latin, Greek and Cyrillic extended scripts, with Noto filling in for other language scripts [[More Info]](https://material.google.com/style/typography.html#)
    +  Weight balancing is an important aspect of typography, the fundamental concept of which is that the larger a typeface is, the less its weight should be so that it doesn't appear too thick and balances its weight with smaller typefaces of higher weights
    +  Typography should align to a 4dp baseline grid, and maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 based on luminance values, with a recomemended ratio being 7:1.
    +  The ideal reading length for large blocks of text is 40 to 60 characters per line. Anything less is too narrow and anything more is too wide.
    
  
+ **Icons**
    + Icons should be designed at 48dp, with 1dp edges, which equates to 
        +  48px by 48px at mdpi
        +  72px by 72px at hdpi
        +  96px by 96px at xhdpi
        +  144px by 144px at xxhdpi
        +  192px by 192px at xxxhdpi
    + An additional icon of 512px by 512px should be designed for use on Google Play
    + Material icons, in addition to the base icon, should contain the following important elements
        + 1dp tinted edge at the top
        + 1dp shaded edge at the bottom
        + Contact shadow - a soft shadow around all edges of raised elements
        + Finish - a soft tint to provide surface lighting, fading from upper life to lower right [[More Info]](https://material.google.com/style/icons.html#icons-product-icons)
   
+ **Ripples**
  + When implementing Ripple Effect use `?attr/selectableItemBackground` instead of `?android:attr` ([Ref](https://twitter.com/pareshmayani/status/772061422729637893))
  + When implementing Ripples contained within the view like Button, use ([Ref](https://twitter.com/pareshmayani/status/772268888931176448))

    ```xml
    android:background="?attr/selectableItemBackground" 
    ```
  + When implementing Ripples that extend beyond the view's bounds like ImageView: ([Ref](https://twitter.com/pareshmayani/status/772269413290520576))
  
    ```xml
    ?attr/selectableItemBackgroundBorderless
    ```


+ **Other Points to Note**
  + Views should be aligned to Material Design's 8dp baseline grid and the keylines when possible. This gives the UI a sense of structure and hierarchy. [[More Info]](https://material.google.com/layout/metrics-keylines.html)
  + If you plan on keeping a reference to any ViewGroup (LinearLayout, FrameLayout, RelativeLayout, etc.), and you don’t want to use any methods specific to this particular type of Layout, keep it as a ViewGroup object. [[More Info]](https://android.jlelse.eu/android-pro-tip-1-443f423b4de6#.pklc9djmc)
  + While picking an accent color (if the brand already has one), pick a color complementary to the primary color so that the contrast is high enough
